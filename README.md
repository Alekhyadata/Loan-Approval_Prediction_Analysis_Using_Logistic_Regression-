# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction Analysis  

This project focuses on analyzing loan application data and predicting whether a loan will be approved based on applicant information. The goal is to help financial institutions make data-driven lending decisions efficiently.  

---

### 🎯 Objective  
To predict loan approval status using applicant demographic and financial data, leveraging data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques.  

---

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn 
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  

---

### 🔍 Project Workflow  
1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and data type corrections  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized patterns between income, loan amount, and approval rate  
3. Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and created new derived features  
4. Model Building:Trained multiple classification models to predict loan approval  
5. Evaluation: Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC
